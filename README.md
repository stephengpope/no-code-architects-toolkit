# No-Code Architects Toolkit API 

Tired of wasting thousands of dollars on API subscriptions to support all your automations? What if there was a free alternative?

The 100% FREE No-Code Architects Toolkit API processes different types of media. It is built in Python using Flask.

## What Can It Do?

The API can convert audio files. It creates transcriptions of content. It translates content between languages. It adds captions to videos. It can do very complicated media processing for content creation. The API can also manage files across multiple cloud services like Google Drive, Amazon S3, Google Cloud Storage, and Dropbox.

You can deploy this toolkit in several ways. It works with Docker. It runs on Google Cloud Platform. It functions on Digital Ocean. You can use it with any system that hosts Docker.

Easily replace services like ChatGPT Whisper, Cloud Convert, Createomate, JSON2Video, PDF(dot)co, Placid and OCodeKit.

## Installation Guides

This API can be deployed to various cloud platforms:

### Digital Ocean

The Digital Ocean App platform is pretty easy to set up and get going, but it can cost more then other cloud providers.

#### Important: Long running processes

You need to use the "webhook_url" (for any request that exceeds 1 min) in your API payload to avoid timeouts due to CloudFlair proxy timeout.

If you use the webhook_url, there is no limit to the processing length.

- [Digital Ocean App Platform Installation Guide](https://github.com/stephengpope/no-code-architects-toolkit/blob/main/docs/cloud-installation/do.md) - Deploy the API on Digital Ocean App Platform

### Google Cloud RUN Platform

Sometimes difficult for people to install (especially on Google Business Workspaces), lots of detailed security exceptions.

However this is one of the cheapest options with great performance because you're only charged when the NCA Toolkit is processesing a request.

Outside of that you are not charged.

#### Imporatnt: Requests exceeding 5+ minutes can be problemactic 

GCP Run will terminate long rununing processes, which can happen when processing larger files (whether you use the webhook_url or not).

However, when your processing times are consistant lower than 5 minutes (e.g. you're only process smaller files), it works great! The performance is also great and as soon as you stop making requests you stop paying.

They also have a GPU option that might be usable for better performance (untested).

### General Docker Instructions

You can use these instructions to deploy the NCA Toolkit to any linux server (on any platform)

You can more easily control performance and cost this way, but requires more technical skill to get up and running (not much though).

## Testing the API

1. Install the **[Postman Template](https://bit.ly/49Gkh61)** on your computer
2. Import the API example requests from the template
3. Configure your environment variables in Postman:
   - `base_url`: Your deployed API URL
   - `x-api-key`: Your API key configured during installation
4. Use the example requests to validate that the API is functioning correctly
5. Use the **[NCA Toolkit API GPT](https://bit.ly/4feDDk4)** to explore additional features
